## All done - you're subscribed! âœ…

You'll be among the first to receive the inaugural issue in due time.

To make sure that issues are delivered to your inbox, add <newsletter@kitia.net> to your contacts or safe senders list.

By default, you'll see both "thoughts" and "launches" within newsletter issues, when applicable. If you'd like information about what those mean or change your preferences, look for the "Update preferences" link at the bottom of any email from <newsletter@kitia.net>.

You'll only receive email from me from addresses ending in @kitia.net. I'll never share your email address with anyone else.

## About

I'm a highschool student located in Chicago. I call myself a builder because I enjoy building things, mostly software at the moment.

I write here mostly for myself, to document my own life, projects, and opinions. I also tend to write about stuff I care about, which usually includes tech, iOS/web design and development, software & workflows, and internet happenings.

Anyone else reading, enjoying, learning from, or otherwise appreciating the writings published here would be a delightful side effect of using the internet as my journal.

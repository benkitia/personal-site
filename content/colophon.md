## About the Writer

I'm a student located in Chicago in my Junior year of highschool. I enjoy building things, mostly software and big ideas at the moment.

### Why & what I write

I write here mostly for myself, to document growth and changes in my own life, projects, and opinions. I also write about other stuff I care about; tech, software design and development, apps & workflows, and current events.

Anyone else reading, enjoying, learning from, or otherwise appreciating the thoughts published here would be a delightful side effect of using the internet as my journal.

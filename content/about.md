## About the writer

I'm, foremost, a junior (3rd year) at my public high school in South Loop, Chicago where I'm founding, leading, and teaching my school's first [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com). Outside of school, I enjoy building things. Right now, I'm building the foundation for some ideas I think you'll want to [hear about](/subscribe/#project-updates) in the future. In addition to some commission web dev work, I'm also constantly writing for and iterating upon this website and sporadically working on smaller [side projects](/projects).

### Why and what I write

I write here mostly for myself, to document growth and changes in my own life, projects, and opinions. I also write about other stuff I care about; tech, software design and development, apps & workflows, and current events.

Anyone else reading, enjoying, learning from, or otherwise appreciating the thoughts published here would be a delightful side effect of using the internet as my journal.

## About the website

I call this website my life's work because it (the design + markup & styling) is probably the single creative project I've spend the most care, time, and thought on. Since it's my [permanent](/tags/content-permanence/) spot on the internet, I've been consistently [iterating](https://github.com/bensonkitia/bensonkitia.com/commits/main) on it since it's inception at the end of 2021 to make it a place I'm proud to call my own. Changes will slow dramatically when I'm at a point where I'm completely satisfied with the design and functionality, but I plan to never stop writing here.

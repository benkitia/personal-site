[I’m a philosopher, entrepreneur, developer.](https://nat.org)

Some things about me:

- Building software (companies)
    - Founder/emcee of [Helianth](https://helianth.co)
      - Currently focused on advancing digital content interfaces, starting with building [marketing tools for storytelling startups](https://talesuite.com)
  - Having fun hacking on anything I can get my cursor into. Cooking up a lil iOS utility at the moment

Some things I believe:

- Romanticizing life is necessary
- Empathize infinitely, sympathize sparingly
- A bell curve’s left has more to teach when observed than its center when heeded or its right when idolized
- Honesty is (only) owed to yourself

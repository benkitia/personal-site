Iâ€™m a philosopher, [entrepreneur, developer.](https://nat.org)

Some things about me:

- Senior in high school
- Growing up in Chicago since 2006
- Enamored with software since [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone)
- Building software (companies)
  - Founder/CEO of [Helianth](https://helianth.co)
  - Having fun hacking on anything I can get my cursor into. Cooking up a lil iOS utility at the moment

Some things I believe:

- We, as early humans, have a duty to ethically [accelerate toward](https://beff.substack.com/p/notes-on-eacc-principles-and-tenets) abundance, which is the only economic solution
- Incentives are always the ðŸ”‘ to any human-related issue
- Infinite empathy â†’ conservative sympathy

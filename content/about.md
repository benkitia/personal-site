[I’m philosopher, entrepreneur, hacker.](https://nat.org)

Some things about me:

- Senior in high school
- Growing up in Chicago since 2006
- Enamored with software since [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone)
- Gonna build software (companies) for the rest of my career hopefully, starting with a Substack competitor

Some things I believe:

- Romanticizing life is necessary
- Empathize infinitely, sympathize sparingly
- A bell curve’s left has more to teach when observed than its center when heeded or its right when idolized
- Honesty is (only) owed to yourself

[I’m a philosopher, entrepreneur, developer.](https://nat.org)

Some things about me:

- Senior in high school
- Growing up in Chicago since 2006
- Enamored with software since [2007](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPhone) 
- Building software (companies)
    - Currently focused on advancing digital content interfaces. I’m starting with [marketing tools for storytelling startups](https://twitter.com/tellsuite)
    - Having fun hacking on anything I can get my cursor into. Cooking up a lil iOS utility at the moment

Some things I believe:

- Romanticizing life is necessary
- Empathize infinitely, sympathize sparingly
- A bell curve’s left has more to teach when observed than its center when heeded or its right when idolized
- Honesty is (only) owed to yourself

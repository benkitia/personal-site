Hi! I'm Benson Kitia, a 16 year old builder in Chicago.

Right now, outside of being a full-time student, I'm leading + teaching skills at a [Hack Club](https://hackclub.com), doing some commission web dev work, imagining + designing for my [upcoming brand](https://realize.lol), and writing about my thoughts. [Subscribe](/subscribe) to follow along!

I'd love for you to connect with me on socials ([Twitter](https://twitter.com/bensonkitia), [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@kitia), [GitHub](https://github.com/bensonkitia)) or get in touch with me via [email](mailto:hello@bvk.email) or [Twitter DM](https://twitter.com/messages/compose?recipient_id=1188270454303277056).

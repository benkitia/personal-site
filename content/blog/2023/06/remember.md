Here's an Apple Note of advice to myself that I'll periodically update

- It’s not my day to watch them
- Romanticizing life is necessary
- Empathize infinitely, sympathize sparingly
- Things are always where they ended up
- Do it for yourself
- A bell curve’s left has more to teach when observed than its center when heeded or its right when idolized
- Honesty is only owed to yourself

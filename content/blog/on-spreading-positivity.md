"Spread positivity" is a common saying that's pretty agreeable. The world needs more of it. However, it's unreasonable to expect one to be exceedingly cheery and do-gooding every day, especially those who, due to circumstance, don't have much positivity to spread.

I like my mantra better; **if you're having a good day, take it out on everyone**.

You likely have no problem making it known to the world when you're having a rough day or week, so why not use a *good* mood as an excuse to go above and beyond in your treatment of others. Compliment that stranger's shirt with a big smile, or drop a $5 bill in the tip jar on your morning coffee run. It'll make your day even better.

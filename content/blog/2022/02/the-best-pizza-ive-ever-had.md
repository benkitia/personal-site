I had the best pizza I've ever had in my life today at [The Beetle Bar and Grill in Chicago, IL](https://www.thebeetlechicago.com/). 10.0/10. It doesn't look like much, but my friends did agreed after initially thinking I was being over-dramatic. 0 notes on the pizza, but the Pepsi I got (when I ordered Coke) tasted like it was out of a room-temperature-to-lukewarm 2-liter that had been sitting out with the cap off for days. But the pizza and music was so great I'll definitely be returning despite the sub-par pop (and service).

Anyway, here's the pizza, "The Roni" at The Beetle Bar and Grill:

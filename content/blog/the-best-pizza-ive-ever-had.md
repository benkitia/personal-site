I had the best pizza I've ever had in my life today at [The Beetle Bar and Grill in Chicago, IL](https://www.thebeetlechicago.com/). 10.0/10. My friends agreed, after initially thinking I was being over-dramatic. 0 notes on the pizza, but the Pepsi I got when I ordered Coke tasted like it was out of a room-temperature-to-lukewarm 2-liter that had been sitting out with the cap off for days. I definitely will being returning despite the sub-par pop and service, because the pizza and music (featuring Freddie Gibbs and MF DOOM!) was so great.

Anyway, here's the pizza, "The Roni" at The Beetle Bar and Grill:

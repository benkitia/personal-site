## Blog posts

### RSS

To subscribe to an RSS feed of all new blog posts, use this link: <https://www.kitia.net/index.xml>.

#### by category or tag

To subscribe to an RSS feed of new posts in/with specific [categories](/categories) or [tags](/tags), filter [all posts](/blog) by the category or tag you'd like to subscribe to, and then use the link at the bottom of that category/tag's page.

Alternatively, you can add the feed to your RSS client with the following syntax:

By category e.g. "Example Category": `https://www.kitia.net/categories/example-category/index.xml`

By tag e.g. "example tag": `https://www.kitia.net/tags/example-tag/index.xml`

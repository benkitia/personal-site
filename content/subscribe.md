## Email

I haven't gotten email subscriptions set up quite yet, but you can still [click here to add your email to the mailing list](#tally-open=wvzG0w&tally-layout=modal&tally-align-left=1&tally-hide-title=1) to be opted in when it is set up.

If that link doesn't do anything, you may need to disable a browser setting or extension that's blocking Javascript.

Note that for now you **will not** receive new writings in your inbox. You can still suscribe with the methods below which work fine.

## RSS

You can subscribe to an RSS feed of new writings by [clicking here](https://bensonkitia.com/index.xml).

Alternatively, you can manually add the feed to your RSS client with this link: <https://bensonkitia.com/index.xml>.

## Twitter

You can follow a feed of new writings [here](https://twitter.com/bensonkitiacom) (@bensonkitiacom) and [enable notifications](https://help.twitter.com/en/managing-your-account/notifications-on-mobile-devices) so you don't miss a new writing.
